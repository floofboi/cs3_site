            <div id="content">
                <p id="p1"> Traffic is a very big problem in Metro Manila. It plagues commuters and motorists alike. In EDSA alone, there are more than 7,500 vehicles using the road per hour for each direction. That is way more than the road's capacity of 6,000 vehicles per direction, and that figure is only expected to grow. Traffic congestion is a big roadblock to not only the economy of the capital but also to the welfare of its people. </p>

                <p> Commuters and motorists in Metro Manila spend 66 minutes in traffic a day on average. It is a needless waste of productivity on the part of the economy, and a source of stress on the part of their welfare. According to study by JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency), the Philippines loses P3.5 billion a day due to Metro Manila traffic, and this figure is expected to balloon to P5.4 billion a day in 2035 if nothing is to be done. But what actually causes the traffic? Too many cars? Too few roads? Bad public transportation? The MMDA, as well as many Local Government Units (LGUs) have commented on the issue. </p>

                    <p> This is Ernesto Pernia, a Filipino economist and the current Director-General of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) which is the government agency which deals with socioeconomic planning in the country.</p>

                <p>As the head of NEDA, Ernesto Pernia approves major infrastructure developments before construction. Some of the projects that NEDA is currently pursuing in Metro Manila is the Mega Manila Subway (located between EDSA and C5), the Skyway Stage 3 and the NLEX-SLEX Connector (which seeks to connect the two major expressways together by elevated roads to bypass the busy roads in the center of Metro Manila), and the North-South Railway (which runs from Tarlac to Laguna). While these projects are expected to not only ease traffic but also to stimulate the economy, their constructions have also been a source of temporary traffic.
