                        Traffic is a very big problem in Metro Manila. It plagues commuters and motorists alike. In EDSA alone, there are more than 7,500 vehicles using the road per hour for each direction. That is way more than the road's capacity of 6,000 vehicles per direction, and that figure is only expected to grow. Traffic congestion is a big roadblock to not only the economy of the capital but also to the welfare of its people.

                    The Philippines loses 3.5 Billion pesos due to traffic in Metro Manila.

                <p>
                    Commuters and motorists in Metro Manila spend 66 minutes in traffic a day on average. It is a needless waste of productivity on the part of the economy, and a source of stress on the part of their welfare. According to study by JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency), the Philippines loses P3.5 billion a day due to Metro Manila traffic, and this figure is expected to balloon to P5.4 billion a day in 2035 if nothing is to be done. But what actually causes the traffic? Too many cars? Too few roads? Bad public transportation? The MMDA, as well as many Local Government Units (LGUs) have commented on the issue.
