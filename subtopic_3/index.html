                <p>One major effect of traffic is the waste of time people suffer: hours of waiting on the road could have been hours of sleep or work time. In the long run, it harms both the people and the economy. Delays in deliveries for various goods can disrupt schedules.</p>

                <p>The effects of traffic take a severe toll on our society. That's why EDSA and C5 are infamously known for being hellish roads. A single road accident can cause hundreds of people to be late for school or work.</p>

                    <h1>â€œ</h1>
                    <p>The sheer amount of stress and anger has caused road rage to be a major consequence of traffic. This can result in vehicle damage and road accidents, which in turn, make the traffic even worse. <em>It's a vicious cycle.</em> </p>
                </div>

                </div>
                <p>Finally, traffic as a whole damages our environment and the people who inhabit it. The exhaust that comes out of cars takes a toll on the ozone layer. Over time, this will contribute to climate change. The health of people who operate in these roads are at risk, due to prolonged exposure to smoke over time.</p>
