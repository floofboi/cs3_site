                        This widespread system meant to lessen the traffic congestion (and arguably makes it worse) goes as follows: certain cars, 
                        depending on the last number on their plate number, will be prohibited from driving at all. Some argue that this prompts many 
                        people to buy multiple cars, thus, making the traffic worse.

                        In recent events, some incidents of homicide are due to road rage. Shootings and hit-and-runs 
                        are caused by traffic incidents. This, along with traffic incidents happen because of traffic 
                        congestion, unfortunately costing lives.

                    <h2> Accident-causing acts </h2>    
                    <h3> Illegal parking</h3>
                    <p> Illegal parking is obstruction(since you either stay on prohibited property, block the driveway,
                        or stall traffic) and is punishable by fines from Php 150 to 2,000 and in some cases towing. 
                    </p>

                    <h3> Reckless Driving </h3>
                    <p> The Department of Justice defines "reckless driving" as: </p>
                    <div class="wow-text">
                        <h1>“</h1>
                        <p>
                            1) Not considering the width, traffic, grades, crossing, curvatures, visibility, and other conditions of the highway and 
                            the conditions of the atmosphere and weather; <br>
                            2) Endagering the property or the safety or rights of any person; <br>
                            3) Causing excessive or unreasonable damage to the highway. In short, "Everytime a person operates a motor vehicle 
                            in violation of traffic rules, at the risk of harming others and with less than the full attention, focus, and skill 
                            required of every driver, he is driving recklessly."
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p> Reckless driving is a punishable offense under Republic Act 4136, or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code.</p>
                    <p> Common forms of reckless driving include: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Over-speeding</li>
                        <li>Drunk-driving</li>
                        <li>Distracted driving</li>
                        <li>Street Racing</li>
                        <li>Aggressive driving</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Motorcycle lane policy</h3>
                    <p> 
                        The MMDA enforces a motorcycle lane policy in major roadways and to segregate motorcyces from heaver and larger vehicles. However, 
                        other vehicles can use the lane as it is not fenced, which may defeat its purpose. The motorcycle lane is supposed to make major 
                        roadways more orderly and safer for both motorcycle riders and other motorists. Motorcycles not using the lane can face a Php 500 fine. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Illegal Counterflow</h3>
                    <p>
                        Counterflowing is one of the most dangerous infractions as it can easily result in a collision if oncoming traffic faces the violator. 
                        This can result in car damage, injury, or even death. If not, oncoming traffic is likely to halt or to swerve to avoid the violator, 
                        contributing further to traffic.
                    </p>
