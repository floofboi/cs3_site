                </div>
                <p> Commuters and motorists in Metro Manila spend 66 minutes in traffic a day on average. It is a needless waste of productivity on the part of the economy, and a source of stress on the part of their welfare. According to study by JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency), the Philippines loses P3.5 billion a day due to Metro Manila traffic, and this figure is expected to balloon to P5.4 billion a day in 2035 if nothing is to be done. But what actually causes the traffic? Too many cars? Too few roads? Bad public transportation? The MMDA, as well as many Local Government Units (LGUs) have commented on the issue. </p>

                <p>As the head of NEDA, Ernesto Pernia approves major infrastructure developments before construction. Some of the projects that NEDA is currently pursuing in Metro Manila is the Mega Manila Subway (located between EDSA and C5), the Skyway Stage 3 and the NLEX-SLEX Connector (which seeks to connect the two major expressways together by elevated roads to bypass the busy roads in the center of Metro Manila), and the North-South Railway (which runs from Tarlac to Laguna). While these projects are expected to not only ease traffic but also to stimulate the economy, their constructions have also been a source of temporary traffic.
