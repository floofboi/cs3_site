                <p id="p1">The problem of traffic in Metro Manila has huge consequences on the economy of the country and the welfare of the citizens of the capital. Therefore, the government has been trying to look for solutions to rid the roads of chronic traffic. One of these solutions is to construction. The Duterte administration launched "Build, Build, Build", a program which sets to level up the country's infrastructure. Many of its projects, though, had actually started in the previous administration. Trains are just one of the solutions that the government has tried. Pictured to the left is the Subway project, which runs between the busy roads of EDSA and C5. Other train projects include the MRT-7 project and the North-South Commuter Railway Project.</p>
                <p id="p2"> Construction projects are among the solutions that the government is trying to implement to decrease congestion. </p>

                <br>

                
                <p> The government has also tried to build roads to connect the South to the North. These have attempted to provide alternatives to EDSA and C5, which are very busy roads. The Skyway Stage 3 Project runs from the old end of Skyway to NLEX in the north. The NLEX-SLEX Connector has the same endpoints but with a different route.</p>
                <br>    
                <p> While these road projects bridge infrastructure gaps, they are also big sources of traffic in the short-term. These projects can also encourage more cars onto the roads, which may backfire. The train projects, meanwhile, serve to improve public transportation, which may have larger and more positive effects. </p>

                <p>
                    Specific to EDSA, the government has tried other solutions. They have separated buses into categories with different stop points. They have segregated buses and private vehicles. They also tried to ban provincial buses, although that measure caused a large backlash. They also tried coding based on car colors and plate numbers. Overall, it seems that these measures are merely band aid solutions. They are less effective than solutions that improve public transportation or infrastructure. If the government wants to remove congestion, they must work to rid it of its causes.
