                <p id="p1"> Have you ever wondered what makes the traffic in Metro Manila so bad? Traffic can't just arise from anywhere, right? That is a question that policymakers like the MMDA and LGUs have tried to ask. While it is impossible to know all the variables which come into play in traffic, it is important to know the big causes so that there is a clear image of why traffic happens for policymakers to work with. To solve traffic, we must solve the causes, not the effects. The MMDA has gathered and published statistics detailing the major causes of traffic. </p>

                        <p> Traffic in Metro Manila is a nuanced issue with many roots and causes. Shown here is an image of EDSA, one of the busiest roads in the capital.</p>
                </div>
                <p> Commuters and motorists in Metro Manila spend 66 minutes in traffic a day on average. It is a needless waste of productivity on the part of the economy, and a source of stress on the part of their welfare. According to study by JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency), the Philippines loses P3.5 billion a day due to Metro Manila traffic, and this figure is expected to balloon to P5.4 billion a day in 2035 if nothing is to be done. But what actually causes the traffic? Too many cars? Too few roads? Bad public transportation? The MMDA, as well as many Local Government Units (LGUs) have commented on the issue. </p>

                <p>As we can see from the statistics that the MMDA and LGUs have published, there are many main causes in play in roads in Metro Manila. The largest of these is saturated demand. As the economy grows larger, people start to buy more cars. So, EDSA's 6,000 vehicles per hour per direction limit has already been exceeded by the current value of 7,500 vehicles per hour per direction. Other major causes include mixed traffic with pedestrians (especially in minor and medium roads), boarding and alighting of PJUs, unruly driving habits, illegal roadside parking, and more. Note that these statistics combine data for major and minor roads.

                </div>

                <p>Of course, different roads may have different problems. According to MMDA statistics, some roads like C5 and R6 (Aurora Blvd. onwards to Rizal) have saturated demand accounting for traffic at 50%. In EDSA, meanwhile, saturated demand and mixed traffic with pedestrians have a combined output of more than 50%. The important takeaway from here is that different roads can have different problems plaguing them to varying degrees.
                                    </p>

                <p>It is important to see that there are many problems that cause traffic in Metro Manila. The issue is very complicated, but data and statistics can help us know how to ease traffic. To move towards better roads, we must cooperate with each other and with the government in solving Manila's chronic traffic problem.
